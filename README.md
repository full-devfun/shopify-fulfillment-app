## Deploy

(make sure you did `git clone`) 

1.  **`Get api credentials`**:
- Create a custom app through the Shopify partner account
- Go to the App config page and copy `API key` and `API secret`

2. **`Firebase Config`**:
- Create a firebase project and create a firestore database (not using RTDB)
- Go to the firebase console and navigate to `Firebase/authentication`.
- Click on "Add signin method" and enable the google signin method
- Go to `Firestore` and click on the rules tab
  and replace the line `auth == true` with `auth !== null`
- Click on the `settings` icon on the Firebase console and click `project settings`
  When you scroll down, you will find the config var `firebaseConfig` \
  copy it.
- Go to the `src/utils/firebase.js` file and find the var `firebaseConfig`
 Replace it with the configvar you just copied.
- Go to the `src/constants/index.js` file and find the const `collection_name` \
This is the name of the collection you will be using.

3.  **`Register config vars on the cloud environment`**:
- Go to the firebase directory by running `cd firebase`
- Run `firebase login` and selecte a firebase project you want to deploy

```
const app = admin.initializeApp({
  projectId: "fulfillments-admin",
});
```
Make sure that the projectId is correct.
- Run `firebase init functions`
- Run the following command to register the config vars
`firebase functions:config:set shopify.secret="COPIED API SECRET" shopify.id="COPIED API KEY"`
- Deploy your functions for the change to take effect by running `firebase deploy --only functions`

4. **`Deploy hosting`**:
- Make sure you're in the root directory
- Go to the constants/index.js file and find the constant `"apiKey"`.\
Replace the value with the Shopify API key you copied from the Shopify partner account.
- Run `npm install`
- Run `firebase login` and selecte a firebase project you want to deploy
- Run `firebase init` in the root directory
- Choose all default settings except the deploy directory. It is `Public` by default but it should be `build`

 `npm run build` and  `firebase deploy --only hosting`

### OAuth Process : 
Online access must be explicitly requested during the authorization phase of OAuth. Tokens with online access mode are linked to an individual user on a store, where the access token's lifespan matches the lifespan of the user's web session. \
<br>

### The OAuth Flow :
<img src="./resources/oauth.png">
- The merchant makes a request to install the app.
- The app redirects to Shopify to load the OAuth grant screen and requests the required scopes.
- Shopify displays a prompt to the merchant to give authorization to the app, and prompts the merchant to log in if required.
- The merchant consents to the scopes and is redirected to the redirect_uri.
- The app makes an access token request to Shopify including the client_id, client_secret, and code.
- Shopify returns the access token and requested scopes.
- The app uses the access token to make requests to the Shopify API.
Shopify returns the requested data. \
<br><br>

### Installation permissions prompt :
<img src="./resources/install.png">

- After granting the permission prompt, Shopify returns the access_token

- PERMISSION PROMPT URL: \
 ```
 https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/oauth/authorize?client_id={api_key}&scope={scopes}&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}&state={nonce}&grant_options[]={access_mode}
 ```
- Confirm installation: \
```
https://example.org/some/redirect/uri?code={authorization_code}&hmac=da9d83c171400a41f8db91a950508985&host={base64_encoded_hostname}&timestamp=1409617544&state={nonce}&shop={shop_origin}&host={host}
```
- Get a permanent access token: \

```
POST https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/oauth/access_token
```

***RESPONSE***

```
{
  "access_token": "f85632530bf277ec9ac6f649fc327f17",
  "scope": "write_orders,read_customers"
}
```

- Grant Access

```
https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/oauth/authorize
```
